/**
 * This part of the program is heavily based on:
 * Sharon G, Stern R, Felner A, Sturtevant N.
 * Conflict-Based Search For Optimal Multi-Agent Path Finding 2015.
 *
 * Many of the comments and explanations are segments from the article.
 *
 * Represents nodes in a ConstraintTree
 * At the high-level, CBS searches a constraint tree (CT). A
 * CT is a binary tree. Each node N in the CT contains
 * the following fields of data: (1) A set of constraints
 * (N.constraints). The root of the CT contains an empty
 * set of constraints. The child of a node in the CT inherits the
 * constraints of the parent and adds one new constraint for one
 * agent. (2) A solution (N.solution). A set of k paths, one
 * path for each agent. The path for agent a1 must be consistent
 * with the constraints of a1.
 * Such paths are found by the lowlevel (3) The total cost (N.cost) of the current solution
 * (summation over all the single-agent path costs). We denote
 * this cost the f-value of the node.
 * Node N in the CT is a goal node when N.solution is
 * valid, i.e., the set of paths for all agents have no conflicts.
 * The high-level performs a best-first search on the CT where
 * nodes are ordered by their costs
 *
 * @param <C> The type used to represent constraints
 * @param <P> The type used to represent paths
