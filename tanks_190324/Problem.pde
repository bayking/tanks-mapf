/**
 * Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach (3rd Edition): page 66.<br>
 * <br>
 * A problem can be defined formally by five components: <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <b>initial state</b> that the agent starts in.</li>
 * <li>A description of the possible <b>actions</b> available to the agent.
 * Given a particular state s, ACTIONS(s) returns the set of actions that can be
 * executed in s.</li>
 * <li>A description of what each action does; the formal name for this is the
 * <b>transition model, specified by a function RESULT(s, a) that returns the
 * state that results from doing action a in state s.</b></li>
 * <li>The <b>goal test</b>, which determines whether a given state is a goal
 * state.</li>
 * <li>A <b>path cost</b> function that assigns a numeric cost to each path. The
 * problem-solving agent chooses a cost function that reflects its own
 * performance measure. The <b>step cost</b> of taking action a in state s to
 * reach state s' is denoted by c(s,a,s')</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This implementation provides an additional solution test. It can be used to
 * compute more than one solution or to formulate acceptance criteria for the
 * sequence of actions.
 *
 * @param <S> The type used to represent states
 * @param <A> The type of the actions to be used to navigate through the state space

     * delegates the check to the goal test. Other implementations could make use of the additional
     * information given by the node (e.g. the sequence of actions leading to the node). To compute
     * all or the five best solutions (not just the best), tester implementations could return false
     * and internally collect the paths of all nodes whose state passes the goal test until enough
